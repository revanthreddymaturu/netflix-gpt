#Please note that, by the time you are accessing the public link, APIs may not work as expected. This is because I have used OpenAIs gpt 3.5 api in this project. And it has been stored in the online hosting platform as an environment variable. OpenAI disables such API keys that are compromised. So, please fork/clone/star this project if you plan to use it as a reference and set your own API keys.
